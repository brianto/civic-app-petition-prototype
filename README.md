Everyday City People
====================

In August of 2012, President Obama connected with millions of people of every race, gender, and affluence. Obama's We The People project provided a democratic channel where citizens can join voices and better our country.

We The People's platform is aimed at the entire country, not at local governments. Local politicians may not find petitions for the cities and counties they govern.

Everyday City People aims to provide a platform for local change, where residents can join voices and better our community.
